# Phrase Product Workshop

## Setup

For our workshop you'll need `git`,`phrase` and `node`.
See these links for installation instructions:

https://git-scm.com/ (this one is most likely already installed on your machine)

https://phrase.com/cli/

https://nodejs.org/en/

You can check if these are installed by typing `git --version`, `phrase info` and `node --version` into your terminal and hitting enter. If you are unsure, send the output to @Patrick Hampel ðŸ™‚
