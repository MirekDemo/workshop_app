# Phrase Product Workshop

## Setup

For our workshop you'll need `phrase` and `node`.
See [here](https://phrase.com/cli/) and [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) for installation instructions.
You can check if these are installed by typing `phrase info` and `node --version` into your terminal and hitting enter. If you are unsure, send the output to @Patrick Hampel ðŸ™‚
